Tap: Generating resources over time (Resource Income)

Inventory: a limited storage (Resource storage), 
capped to limit players from progressing too fast

Converter: Convert resources into other useful items
(For example: Exp, money)
- lot of separate resource type = chill exploration
- lot of resource overlay conversion = limited conversion

GRIND:
Positive feedback loop
- rewarding for players to go back.
Negative feedback loop
- decrease incentive
- shallow expotential/linear growth for leveling

	How do you make it more things more efficient?
	How to deal with sudden changes?

Drain: Opposite of Tap, removing resources over time
(Example: hunger, weapon wear, food spoil)
A return to the start without the power creep
You can make it interesting by turning Drain into a stock 
market, exchange rate and decay.
